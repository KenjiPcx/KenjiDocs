# KenjiDocs
## Project Details
### What is KenjiDocs?
As the name suggests, it is based on the term **Kenji's Documentation**. Simply put, it is my personal portfolio/blog site!
There is
- A CV page detailing my full experience
- A blogs page for my blogs
- A projects page for my projects (coming soon)
- A simple contact me page

### My motivation for doing this:
- I just thought that it is about time that I had my own site since its 2023 and all devs have one
- I was also interested in revisiting the world of frontend with all the new frameworks around, especially with Astro! I was also looking to pickup TailwindCSS!

### Technologies Used:
This is mostly a static site just to display my info, I used
- Pure Astro without any frontend framework
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Workbox for PWA

### What did I learn from doing this?
- Frontend knowledge for static sites
  - SEO, sitemaps, rss feeds, SSG, lazy loading
- Astro and its features
  - I did this one day after Astro 2.0 came out, so it is fair to say that I picked up everything there is to know about Astro
- TailwindCSS, I like it
  - I like the idea of not needing to name things, don't think I would go back to other forms of using CSS
- PWA
  - I just made this site a PWA for fun, it was interesting to learn about it

## How to install and run the project

## Credits
