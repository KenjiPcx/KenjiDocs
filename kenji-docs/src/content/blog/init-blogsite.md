## Welcome to my blog

A blog is something I've been wanting to start for a while now but never really had the time to work on it, I tried starting one 3 months ago but I got busy and that went nowhere ðŸ˜±. But I recently started the habit of journalling since the start of the new year and I enjoy it, it helps me keep track of my life and gives me something to reflect on. So now I'm applying it to my coding journey, sharing my work publicly its own benefits as well.

And now its life, say hello to KenjiDocs, my personal website!

## What will I be blogging about?

I don't really have a fixed plan for now, but here are some kind of topics you can expect.

### My life

I've dabbled with quite a lot of interesting tech activities for my career and for fun as a student and that doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon, I plan to blog about them and my previous experiences.

This can be anything from

- CS life in the University of Manchester
- Working/Interning at X company
- Doing blockchain development with Encode
- Being a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador

### Projects and coding tutorials

I'll basically just be writing a blogpost whenever I finish a project to share about it to the public. Whenever I encounter any interesting problems in my projects, I'll probably also write standalone coding tutorials on those problems, to spread some light on them if they're especially niche.

### My thoughts on technology

I like keeping up with tech and I want to share my thoughts and reaction to them. I talk about Microsoft technologies, blockchain, AI, cloud ðŸ˜„
