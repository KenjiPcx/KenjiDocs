It's 2022, it is essential for every dev to now have their own personal website, and so I have decided to make my own one right now! Introducing my personal website, its looks plain as hell?

# Why does it look like sh*t?
Now, I know what you all must be thinking. What is this plain ass looking website? A minimalistic design trend? Isn't a personal website supposed to showcase your dev skills? Are my frontend skills just so bad?

### Let me explain!!!
This is all part of the plan, I just wanted to start blogging and get my website out there as soon as possible. I think I have been going through some interesting experiences and I just want a place to record all of that down, this website will serve that purpose for now.

As you can see, the current blogsite is actually the default blog app from Next.js starter tutorial, but the **important thing is that you are able to see my content**. But yea, the site is so bad right now that it can't even render images from blogs.

### Why didn't I just use some third party blog site like medium?
Good question, well I was already thinking of creating a personal portfolio/blog site to begin with for practicing my long forgotten frontend skills. I didn't want to make just a normal website as well, as an aspiring developer, let me overengineer my website for fun! 

Other than that, I wanted to bring you all along the entire journey in watching the website evolve and grow along with the content. 

Doing this also allows me to milk even more content from this project, I'll get to blog about me building my website if you get what I mean.

# The project
So yeah, for the next few months, I will be challenging myself to build my personal website in my free time. I have been spending quite a bit of time looking at insane personal portfolio sites and I am inspired to create my own website of that quality. I have a lot of unneccessary ideas to include in my website, this website is just a place for me to go wild with.

Here are some key features I am looking to implement
- A modern looking personal portfolio app design
- Integration/remake with my [skill tree app](https://skill-tree-backend.firebaseapp.com/)
- A section for my content (talks/blogs/videos)
- A timeline of my career
- A section for side projects
- A lot of 3D animations and UX elements

A lot of ambitious ideas and overengineering, but I think that its doable! With the CI/CD capabilities nowadays, I plan to be doing regular releases maybe every 2 weeks and as I mentioned before, I also plan to regularly blog on my progress for building the site.

# My tech stack
Following the theme of overengineering, I will also be using a stack that I don't really need. 

I plan to use
- Next.js for the app
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Three.js for a lot of 3D animations
- Prisma + Postgres for database
- MDX for blog content
- Vercel for hosting

There isn't a single project without challenges or learning something new I guess? Honestly, I'm just using this opportunity to learn about the tools in my learning list.

# Stay tuned for updates
So yeah, this is the plan for now, stay tuned for updates, maybe a subscription/notification system is something I should add as well?
